title: Server Side Rendering
---

Since Loona is based on Apollo, let's check what is says about SSR:

---

Apollo provides two techniques to allow your applications to load quickly, avoiding unnecessary delays to users:

- Store rehydration, which allows your initial set of queries to return data immediately without a server roundtrip.
- Server side rendering, which renders the initial HTML view on the server before sending it to the client.

You can use one or both of these techniques to provide a better user experience.
